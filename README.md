# XSS-Payloads-MediumToCritical
XSS payloads. Show impact by turning that medium into a critical finding.

I have decided to compile a list of payloads which I have written to increase the impact of XSS.

XSS is consistently a top ten contender on bug bounty platforms and a common finding in pen test reports. But they are often considered to be a mere medium severity vulnerability. How can we show impact to application owners? It is often relatively simple to increase the impact to critical by injecting a javascript payload designed to takeover a users account. 

Having submitted a number of medium severity XSS vulnerabilities myself. Recently, I was fortunate enough to come across an excellent post by [hakluke](https://github.com/hakluke/weaponised-XSS-payloads) containing a number of payloads allowing you to increase the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. The next time I found an XSS, it was going to be critical!
